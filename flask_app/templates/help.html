            <h3>Handling Large Resume Uploads</h3>
            <p>
                When screening many candidates (100+), we recommend a strategic approach that gives you faster results, 
                better reliability, and more control over the hiring process.

                <h4 style="color: #1e40af; margin-top: 0;">🚀 Automatic Background Processing</h4>
                <p>For jobs with <strong>more than {{ background_threshold }} resumes</strong>, the system automatically uses background processing:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>No timeouts:</strong> Large batches process reliably without browser timeout issues</li>
                    <li><strong>Close your browser:</strong> You don't need to keep the page open - your job keeps running</li>
                    <li><strong>Email notification:</strong> You'll receive an email with a direct link when your analysis is ready</li>
                    <li><strong>Check progress:</strong> View real-time progress on the "Background Jobs" page (appears in top menu when jobs are running)</li>
                    <li><strong>Typical time:</strong> 3-5 minutes for batches of 75 to 100 resumes</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> While background processing handles technical reliability, the Two-Pass Strategy below is still recommended for better decision-making and cost efficiency.</p>

            <div class="best-practice-box">
                <h4>🎯 Recommended Strategy: Two-Pass Screening</h4>
                <p>Our elite recruiters use a Two-Pass Executive Strategy to maintain surgical precision at scale. By processing candidates in batches, you create high-velocity feedback loops that allow you to calibrate your criteria in real-time before finalizing your shortlist.</p>
                
                <ol class="guide-steps">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Process in smaller batches (50-100 resumes each)</strong>
                        <p>Break your candidates into manageable groups. This provides faster processing, more reliable results, 
                        and the ability to spot issues early. Each batch typically completes in 1-3 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify top potential candidates from each batch</strong>
                        <p>Review the results from each batch and identify the strongest 5-10 candidates. Look for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High overall scores (typically 65%+)</li>
                            <li>Strong matches on your critical requirements</li>
                            <li>Candidates who stand out from the rest of their batch</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Run one final comparison with only top candidates</strong>
                        <p>Once you've identified the strongest candidates from all batches, create a final job with just these 
                        finalists. This gives you a direct head-to-head comparison of your best candidates, making it easier to 
                        make your final hiring decision.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                <h4>📖 Example Scenario</h4>
                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> You have 300 applications for a Software Engineer role.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Batch 1:</strong> Upload first 100 resumes → Identify good potential candidates (e.g., 8 are worth further consideration)</li>
                    <li><strong>Batch 2:</strong> Use "Run New Batch with Same Criteria" button from Batch 1 results → Upload next 100 resumes → Identify promising candidates (e.g., 7 strong matches)</li>
                    <li><strong>Batch 3:</strong> Use "Run New Batch with Same Criteria" button again → Upload final 100 resumes → Identify top candidates (e.g., 10 standouts)</li>
                    <li><strong>Final Round:</strong> Upload just those 25 finalists → Run detailed comparison</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> You've efficiently narrowed 300 candidates down to your top 25, then performed a detailed 
                analysis on just the finalists who truly have potential.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>💡 Key Feature:</strong> The "Run New Batch with Same Criteria" button (found on any historical job's results page) 
                loads that job's exact criteria settings into your workspace. This ensures all batches are evaluated identically, making results directly comparable. 
                Remember to update the job title (e.g., add "Batch 2", "Batch 3") to keep your batches organized in Job History.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Processing Applications as They Arrive</h3>
            <p>
                This same approach works brilliantly if you want to process applications progressively rather than waiting 
                for all resumes to arrive. Use the "Run New Batch with Same Criteria" feature to ensure consistent evaluation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Process your first 80 applications, get early insights into candidate quality</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Load Week 1 job using "Run New Batch with Same Criteria" → Process the next batch that arrived, identify any standout candidates</li>
                <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Load again with same criteria → Process final batch after closing date</li>
                <li><strong>Final:</strong> Compare only the top candidates from each week</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #666;">
                <strong>Note:</strong> Using the batch feature ensures all weeks are evaluated with identical criteria, making scores directly comparable across time periods.
            </p>
            
            <div class="tip-box" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                <h4>💡 Pro Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Large batches ({{ background_threshold }}+ resumes):</strong> Run automatically in the background - check the "Background Jobs" menu item (appears when jobs are active) or wait for your email notification</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the batch feature:</strong> Click "Run New Batch with Same Criteria" on any historical job to load its exact criteria for new candidates—ensures fair comparison across batches</li>
                    <li><strong>Early insights:</strong> Processing batches early gives you a "sneak peek" at application quality before all resumes arrive</li>
                    <li><strong>Adjust criteria:</strong> If early batches show unexpectedly low scores, you can refine your criteria before processing remaining candidates</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduce costs:</strong> Only pay for detailed AI insights on your finalists, not all 300 candidates</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay organized:</strong> Name your jobs clearly (e.g., "Software Engineer - Batch 1", "Software Engineer - Batch 2", "Software Engineer - Finalists")</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Why Not Process All at Once?</h3>
            <p>
                While the system can handle larger batches (batches over {{ background_threshold }} resumes automatically use background processing, so you won't experience timeouts), breaking them up still provides:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strategic decision-making:</strong> Early batches reveal application quality before processing everyone</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive insights:</strong> Start reviewing top candidates while others are being processed</li>
                <li><strong>Easier management:</strong> Simpler to spot and fix any issues with specific candidates</li>
                <li><strong>Lower costs:</strong> Focus expensive AI insights on only the candidates who matter</li>
                <li><strong>Criteria refinement:</strong> Adjust your criteria based on early results before processing remaining candidates</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How are the scores calculated?</h3>
            <p>
                Our AI evaluates candidates based on the <strong>depth of evidence</strong> provided in their resume for each criterion. 
                It doesn't just look for keywords; it analyzes professional context and career impact.
            </p>
            
            <div class="example-box" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #eff6ff 0%, #dbeafe 100%); border: 2px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #1e40af;">🎯 The Three Pillars of a High Score</h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">To achieve a <strong>"Strong"</strong> score (80%–100%), the AI looks for three specific markers:</p>
                <ol style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
                    <li><strong>Skill Mastery:</strong> Does the candidate possess the required technical or soft skill?</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional Context:</strong> Has the candidate applied this skill in a recent professional role (e.g., as a CFO or Manager)?</li>
                    <li><strong>Proven Outcome:</strong> Does the resume cite a specific result, achievement, or metric (e.g., "Led budget preparation for a $10M portfolio")?</li>
                </ol>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The more pillars present, the higher the score. A score of 60% might indicate the skill is listed but lacks professional context or specific outcomes.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How to use the scores</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Treat scores as <strong>evidence strength indicators</strong>, not pass/fail thresholds</li>
                <li>Use the Coverage Matrix to spot strengths and gaps across all candidates</li>
                <li>Use Deep Insights to see Professional Anchors (job titles + companies) behind each strength</li>
                <li>Review AI-generated Interview Questions to probe areas with moderate scores</li>

                <h3 class="faq-q">How accurate is the scoring?</h3>
                <p class="faq-a">Our scoring engine uses human-level reasoning to understand context beyond simple keywords. While it is an incredibly powerful screening tool for identifying top-tier talent, we always recommend using the AI-powered Evidence Explorer to verify specific claims during your final review.</p>

                <p class="faq-a">Yes! Visit the "Job Criteria" page to review and edit extracted criteria. You can add, remove, or modify criteria before running analysis.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-q">Why did a candidate score 60% if they have the skill listed on their resume?</h3>
                <p class="faq-a">A score of 60% indicates a <strong>"Moderate Match."</strong> This usually occurs when a skill is listed (e.g., in a "Skills" section) but isn't supported by detailed descriptions of projects or outcomes in their "Experience" section. For example, a candidate listing "Advanced Excel" may score lower than one who describes "using Advanced Excel to manage multi-office budgets at Wayne Enterprises".</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-q">What are "Professional Anchors"?</h3>
                <p class="faq-a">Our Deep Insights use <strong>"Professional Anchors"</strong> to link strengths directly to a candidate's history. This means every claim we make is tied to a specific job title and company found in their resume, ensuring the analysis is grounded in fact rather than generic AI summaries.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-q">Can a candidate's score be improved?</h3>
                <p class="faq-a">Scores are based strictly on the provided resume. If a candidate has a lower score due to a brief resume, we recommend using our AI-generated Interview Questions to dig deeper into those specific areas during your screening call.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-q">Where can I find the suggested Interview Questions?</h3>
                <p class="faq-a">Suggested interview questions are integrated directly into your candidate reports.</p>
                <p class="faq-a"><strong>For High-Scoring Criteria:</strong> In the Deep Insights section, the AI may suggest "Discovery Questions" to help you verify the specific achievements mentioned in the resume.</p>
                <p class="faq-a"><strong>For Low-Scoring Criteria:</strong> In the Detailed Scores section, if a candidate scores 0% due to missing evidence, the AI often provides a "Targeted Question". This allows you to quickly ask the candidate about that specific skill during a screening call to see if it was simply omitted from their resume.</p>
                <p class="faq-a"><strong>How should I use these questions?</strong> Think of these questions as your "AI Co-Pilot" for the first interview. They are designed to help you dig past generic bullet points and find the Professional Anchors—the real-world companies and outcomes—that prove a candidate can do the job.</p>

            <h3>Analysis not running</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure you've uploaded both a Job Description and at least one candidate resume</li>
                <li>Check that criteria have been extracted (visible on Job Criteria page)</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Some PDFs (especially scanned documents) may not extract text properly</li>
                <li>Try re-saving the PDF or converting it to DOCX format</li>
                <li>Very complex multi-column layouts may extract better as DOCX</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scores seem too low/high</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Review criteria on Job Criteria page - overly specific criteria may score lower</li>
                <li>Check the Evidence Explorer to see what text is being matched</li>
                <li><strong>Criteria Calibration:</strong> If scores seem lower than expected, your criteria might be overly specific. Try a 'Broad Pass' to see a wider range of talent, then use Deep Dive Insights to refine your top finalists.</li>
