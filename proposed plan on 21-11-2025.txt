nigelfitz: The app.py candidate analyser is workign well enough now that I want to go to the next stage of development / testing. Can you make a backup at this point, and put it in the "Backup app copies" folder ("C:\Users\nigel\OneDrive\Documents\Nigels Documents\ChatGPT\candidate-summariser\Backup app copies" ). Then advise me on what to do next. I think we need to get it up on the web somehow, with a user log in system, so that I can ask potential users to start testing it. But you may have a btter suggestion about what to do next, so please feel free to suggest somethign different if you can think of a better idea/s.

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a backup of your current app.py and then provide recommendations for the next steps. 

Ran terminal command: Copy-Item "c:\Users\nigel\OneDrive\Documents\Nigels Documents\ChatGPT\candidate-summariser\app.py" -Destination "c:\Users\nigel\OneDrive\Documents\Nigels Documents\ChatGPT\candidate-summariser\Backup app copies\appv72-pre-deployment.py"

Backup created as `appv72-pre-deployment.py`.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

You're right that getting it on the web is the logical next step, but I'd suggest a **phased approach** rather than jumping straight to full user authentication:

### **Phase 1: Quick User Testing (1-2 weeks) - RECOMMENDED START**
Deploy to **Streamlit Community Cloud** (free):
- **Pros**: Zero cost, deploy in ~15 minutes, share via simple URL
- **Cons**: No built-in auth, limited resources (1GB RAM), public URL
- **Best for**: Initial user feedback on functionality before investing in infrastructure
- Users access via shared link, no login needed (you can add password protection if needed)

### **Phase 2: Add Basic Authentication (if Phase 1 successful)**
Options:
1. **Streamlit Community Cloud + simple password**: Add `streamlit-authenticator` library for basic multi-user logins
2. **Upgrade to paid hosting**: Heroku, AWS, or Azure with proper authentication

### **Phase 3: Production Deployment (if you have paying users)**
- Full authentication system
- Database for user management
- Scalable infrastructure
- Usage tracking & billing

## My Recommendation: **Start with Phase 1**

**Why?**
- You'll get real user feedback in days, not weeks
- Avoid over-engineering before validating the product
- Free to test
- Easy to migrate later if successful

**Next immediate steps:**
1. Create a Streamlit Community Cloud account (free, uses GitHub)
2. Push your code to a GitHub repository
3. Connect Streamlit Cloud to your repo
4. Share the URL with testers

**Before deploying, we should:**
- Add a simple password gate (optional, takes 5 min)
- Review the requirements.txt to ensure all dependencies are listed
- Test that your OpenAI API key works via environment variables
- Add usage limits per session to control costs

Would you like me to help you prepare for Streamlit Community Cloud deployment, or would you prefer a different approach?
